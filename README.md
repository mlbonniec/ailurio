## Functioning

Ailurio is a web server, running with [`Fastify`](https://www.fastify.io/), which serves images, generated by [`node-canvas`](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) which allows to use HTML canvas from NodeJS.  
The data is retrieved from the GitHub API, using the official GitHub client for NodeJS, [`@octokit/rest.js`](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/).
